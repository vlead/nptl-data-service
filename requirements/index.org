* Introduction
  This document captures the requirements for the realization of this project.

* Key Points
   + This idea is to create an application which will take a Keyword as an
     input and will search for all the assets url containing that keyword in a
     specified database.
  
   + Initially the task is limited to search for about 10 keywords and has to
     list all the occurrences in the json file given as a  database to collect all
     the assets url.
